## Some examples of text processing for bioinformatics ##

There's a data deluge right now in biology that is revolutionizing the science.  This data consists of geographic, climate, morphological character, and most pervasively, genomic data.  All of this data is in text formats, but some of these text formats are different.

To work with this data it helps to have some knowledge of the Unix command line and how data can be accessed, queried, and manipulated quickly and efficiently.

For this brief tutorial, I'll be using some real biological data files found in the data file folder.  The file 
* *fn554767.fasta*	-> this is the sequence data from a bacterial plasmid in fasta format.	
* *fn554767.gff*	-> this is the annotated gene data from the bacterial plasmid in gene feature format (gff).
* *synteny_data.sam*    -> this is a synteny mapping file showing the presence of shared features in two bacterial samples.
