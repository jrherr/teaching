## Josh Herr's Teaching Materials
======================

Here are some teaching materials I am currently developing.  All materials are being developed with a focus on teaching computational skills to biologists with little to no background in computing.

The R material was first developed for the <a href="http://ged.msu.edu/angus/tutorials-2013/">MSU NGS workshop 2013</a>.  Additional material is still in the works for R.

The Shell material is a rough outline, but will be cast into short tutorials (each should take 15 to 30 minutes to run through) and have been inspired by similar tutorials developed by Software Carpentry.  

Python tutorials are in works.  

Please feel free to use and please credit me somewhere in your use/reuse.  Thanks!
