## Josh Herr's Teaching Materials
======================

Here are some teaching materials I have developed.  The R material was first developed for the <a href="http://ged.msu.edu/angus/tutorials-2013/">MSU NGS workshop 2013</a>.  The Shell material was inspired by similar tutorials developed by Software Carpentry.  Python tutorials are in works.  Please feel free to use and please credit me somewhere in your use/reuse.  Thanks!
